In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns
that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

Behavioral patterns are concerned with the assignment of responsibilities between objects,
or, encapsulating behavior in an object and delegating requests to it.
